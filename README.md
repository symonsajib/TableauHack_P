# TableauHack


WHAT IT IS:

TableauHack is a repo containing 2 notebooks (Tableau_Notebook1 & Tableau_Notebook2), which are reference guide to use in conjuction with two tableau courses by Kirill Eremenko. It's arrenged chapter by chapter in accordance with the video courses, so are the concepts. 
1. Tableau_Notebook1: 
for Tableau 10 A-Z: Hands-On Tableau Training For Data Science!

2. Tableau_Notebook2: 
for Tableau 10 Advanced Training: Master Tableau in Data Science   
https://www.udemy.com/share/1013DoBkYYdF9RQQ==/


PREREQUISITEs? : 

Basic know how of Tableau concepts. 


FOR WHOM? : 

1. It's mainly for people who did Kiril's tableau courses and wants to brush up their overall tableau skills without needing them to go back to the video course.
2. For new learners, Just know that there is some written notes here which can be useful later after you learn the initial basics of tableau. But remeber, TableauHack is definitely not a standalone guide to learn tableau. 
3. While working on a project in tableau, it's fairly common to get stuck on some specific concepts or forget how to use them. TableauHack can be a great resource for this situation too. 


WHY? : 

I learned the tableau from a lot of source. But the courses from Kiril Erimenko was a great start. But often times while working with tableau I found myself in the situation where I lost memory of some specific concept or how to apply them on my dashboards. So I need to go back to  video courses which can be little time consiming  and also not so convinient. I felt if there is a written note, it would be much easier to review. 


### Tableau_Notebook2 is still under construction !!! ###

"There is a magic in graphs. The proﬁle of a curve reveals in a ﬂash a whole situation — the life history of an epidemic, a panic, or an era of prosperity. The curve informs the mind, awakens the imagination, convinces."
